# Language Analytics - Spring 2023

This repository contains all of the code and data related to the Spring 2023 module _Language Analytics_ as part of the bachelor's elective in [Cultural Data Science](https://bachelor.au.dk/en/supplementary-subject/culturaldatascience/) at Aarhus University.

This repository is in active development, with new material being pushed on a weekly basis.

## Technicalities

The coding part of this course will be run entirely on [UCloud](https://cloud.sdu.dk/). This is to ensure that everyone has access to the same computing resources and to avoid potential conflicts with different operating systems, different versions of Python, and so on.

Students are welcome to develop code locally on their machine instead. However, please not that *no support* will be given for potential problems or errors you encounter!

## Repo structure

This repository has the following directory structure:

| Column | Description|
|--------|:-----------|
| ```data``` | A folder to be used for sample datasets that we use in class |
| ```notebooks``` | This is where you should save all exploratory and experimental notebooks |
| ```src```  | For Python scripts developed in class and as part of assignments |
| ```syllabus```| Contains a full course syllabus and reading list |
| ```utils``` | Utility functions that are written by me, and which we'll use in class. |


## Class times

This class takes place on Wednesdays from 8-12. Teaching will take place in person, and you can find the room number via the AU Timetable.

## Course overview and readings

A detailed breakdown of the course structure and the associated readings can be found in the [syllabus](syllabus/readme.md). Also, be sure to familiarise yourself with the [studieordning](https://eddiprod.au.dk/EDDI/webservices/DokOrdningService.cfc?method=visGodkendtOrdning&dokOrdningId=15952&sprog=en) for the course, especially in relation to examination and academic regulations.

## Contact details
