# Extracting linguistic features using spaCy

This assignment concerns using ```spaCy``` to extract linguistic information from a corpus of texts.

The corpus is an interesting one: *The Uppsala Student English Corpus (USE)*. All of the data is included in the folder called ```in``` but you can access more documentation via [this link](https://ota.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/repository/xmlui/handle/20.500.12024/2457).

For this exercise, you should write some code which does the following:

- Loop over each text file in the folder called ```in```
- Extract the following information:
    - Relative frequency of Nouns, Verbs, Adjective, and Adverbs per 10,000 words
    - Total number of *unique* PER, LOC, ORGS
- For each sub-folder (a1, a2, a3, ...) save a table which shows the following information:

|Filename|RelFreq NOUN|RelFreq VERB|RelFreq ADJ|RelFreq ADV|Unique PER|Unique LOC|Unique ORG|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|file1.txt|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|file2.txt|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|etc|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Objective

This assignment is designed to test that you can:

1. Work with multiple input data arranged hierarchically in folders;
2. Use ```spaCy``` to extract linguistic information from text data;
3. Save those results in a clear way which can be shared or used for future analysis

## Some notes

- The data is arranged in various subfolders related to their content (see the associate README for more info). You'll need to think a little bit about how to do this. You should be able do it using a combination of things we've already looked at, such as ```os.listdir()```, ```os.path.join()```, and for loops.
- The text files contain some extra information that such as document ID and other metadata that occurs between pointed brackets ```<>```. Make sure to remove these as part of your preprocessing steps!
- There are 14 subfolders (a1, a2, a3, etc), so when completed the folder ```out``` should have 14 CSV files.

## Additional comments

Your code should include functions that you have written wherever possible. Try to break your code down into smaller self-contained parts, rather than having it as one long set of instructions.

For this assignment, you are welcome to submit your code either as a Jupyter Notebook, or as ```.py``` script. If you do not know how to write ```.py``` scripts, don't worry - we're working towards that!

Lastly, you are welcome to edit this README file to contain whatever informatio you like. Remember - documentation is important!
