# Session 1

## Overview

In today's lecture, we saw how it was possible to extract some pretty interesting information from large corpora by using only simple word distributions. 

In today's workshop, we're going to see how we can use Python to build simple tools for exploring a large corpora of text, focusing specifically on counting word frequencies and using KWIC concordances.

## Tasks

- Introduction to some fundamental Python tools for string processing
- A quick reminder on how strings and lists work
- Counting word frequencies
- Displaying keywords-in-context
- Group exercises to test your skills
