# Session 3 - NLP for Linguistic Analysis

## Overview

Last week we saw how we can use Python to extract some simple features from texts, such as the frequency and distribution of words in a document. While there is a lot of value to this approach, it is somewhat limited if we are interested in more linguistic information.

In this workshop, we're going to introduce ```spaCy``` one of then most widely used NLP frameworks for working with langauge data. ```spaCy``` uses pretrained models to extract lingusitic fetures from text such as part-of-speech, gramamtical relations, and named entities.

After a short introduction, we'll then start working in-class on the Assignment for this week which can be accessed via [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/PdNi7nPv).
