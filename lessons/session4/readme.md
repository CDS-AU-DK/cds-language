# Session 4 - Text classification 1

## Overview

This week, we've started looking at the basics of machine learning in the context of text classification.

In the lecture, we learned some of the theoretical foundations of machine learning, such as feature extraction and how computers actually learn through minimizing a loss function.

In this practical session, we're going to be looking at how we can build simple machine learning classifiers for text data using a library called ```Scikit-Learn```.

## Tasks

- Text vectorization
- Creating classifier models
- Traning and evaluating them
- Performing cross-validation for robustness
- Saving and loading models for later use
