# Session 5 - Text classification 2

## Overview

This week, we've started looking at how we can move from simple logistic regression classification to working with more sophisticated deep learning models.

In the lecture, we saw how *fully-connected, feed-forward neural networks* build on the same principles as the classifiers we saw last week. In this practical session, we're going to be looking at how we can build simple neural network classifiers for text data using ```Scikit-Learn```.

We're also going to start to look at how we can move away from working in notebooks and instead think about how we can do Python *scripting*. This will be something that we're building on throughout the rest of the remaining semester.

There is a notebook for you to work through in groups, and Assignment 2 is available for you to work start on in class, if we have time. [You can access the repo for Assignment 2 here](https://classroom.github.com/a/qGathgQP).

## Tasks

- Working on neural network notebook
- Basics of Python scripting
- Working on Assignment 2 (text classification)
