       " 'As we came nearer to the shouting, it became more and more apparent that it was made by more than one voice',\n",
       " 'Sometimes, it seemed to stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped',\n",
       " 'When it broke out again, the soldiers made for it at a greater rate than ever, and we after them',\n",
