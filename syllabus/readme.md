## Overview

The purpose of this course is to familiarize students with the tools and techniques used to explore questions about culture through the use of digitized textual data. After taking this course, students will be able to; A) understand how text mining and text analytics are employed in humanities research; B) communicate the advantages and the challenges of quantitative and computationally-assisted approaches to texts; and  C) apply relevant methods of textual analysis to research questions in their primary academic field and present the results.

The course provides an introduction to language and text analytics in theory and in practice, and introduces historical, philosophical, and technological perspectives on this growing field.

Written text is a central focus of scholarship in many areas of humanities and social sciences, and the large-scale digitization of texts and computational text mining tools offer unprecedented opportunities for pattern extraction and quantitative analysis. Emerging over the last two decades, text analytics draws on recent advances in computational linguistics, information retrieval, and machine learning.  We will cover the central approaches used in contemporary research. We will engage with ongoing debates surrounding the role of text analytics in the humanities and social science, and its relationship to traditional methods (e.g. logical analysis, discourse analysis, genre analysis, etc) for analysing texts.

This course will enable students to critically engage with the digitalization revolution in text analytics, and its implications across research disciplines. At the same time, students will gain methodological skills which are valued in both academic research and in the labour market.

## Academic Objectives

In the evaluation of the student‚Äôs performance, emphasis is placed on the extent to which the student is able to:

1. Knowledge:
    * contrast strengths and weaknesses of automated text analysis, compared to more traditional text analysis methods, across different use contexts
    * discuss different types of linguistic data and their affordances for automated data analysis
    * explain how language and text analytics bears on central research questions in the humanities, and its relation to traditional methods
2. Skills:
    * conduct original research using computationally-assisted analysis of digital language data.
3. Competences:
    * critically reflect on the role of text analytics in the students‚Äô primary field
    * independently identify relevant analytical features of digital language data for an original research question.

## Course Assessment
The exam consists of a portfolio containing a number of assignments. The portfolio will consist of 5-7 assignments.
The number of assignments as well as their form and length will be announced at the start of the semester. The portfolio may include products. Depending on their length, and subject to the teacher‚Äôs approval, these products can replace some of the standard pages in the portfolio.

## Participation
Students will be expected to complete the in-class assignments in order to progress to the examination. These assignments are designed first and foremost to develop skills rather than ‚Äúprove‚Äù you have learned concepts. 

I encourage you to communicate and work together, so long as you write and explain your code yourself and do not copy work wholesale. You can learn a lot from replicating others‚Äô code but you will learn nothing if you copy it without knowing how it works.

## Schedule
Each course session (1-13) is four hours long, consisting of a two-hour lecture and two-hour code-along session.

## Additional Resources
The following resources are *not* compulsory assigned readings. Instead, these are a mixture of textbooks and other resources which can be used as reference texts. Specifically, these will be useful for people who want to improve their understanding of linear algebra and neural networks. I strongly recommend all of the textbooks by Gilbert Strang - he's a fantastically clear writer, which is a rare skill among mathematicians. VanderPlas (2016) is a useful reference text for basic data science using Python (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn). It's below the level we'll be working at but it's good to have nevertheless.

## Slack Channel
There is no such thing as a stupid or trivial question. If a fellow student asks a question you know an answer to, try and answer!

 Slack is not only for instructor-student interaction, it is for all students to share knowledge and resources, and to get answers as fast as possible. Slack is best-suited for short technical questions and individual threads or channels for extended conversations on a given topic. 

## Disability Resources
Your experience in this class is important to me. If you have already established accommodations with Special Educational Support (SPS), please communicate your approved accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course. If you have not yet established services through SPS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), you are welcome to contact 8716 2720 (Monday & Thursday 9-12, Tuesday 13-15) or email sps@au.dk .  SES offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary health conditions. Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive process between you, your instructor(s) and SES. It is the policy and practice of the Aarhus University to create inclusive and accessible learning environment and ensure that all students have the opportunity to educate themselves on equal terms even if they have a disability
